# Lambda Configuration Removal Summary

This document summarizes all Lambda-related configurations and files that were removed from the Prayash API project.

## Files Removed

1. **deploy.sh** - AWS Lambda deployment script
2. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - AWS Lambda deployment guide and instructions
3. **data/Helvetica.afm** - Dummy font file created for Lambda packaging
4. **data/Helvetica-Bold.afm** - Dummy font file created for Lambda packaging

## Configuration Changes

### .gitignore
- Removed `# Serverless directories` section
- Removed `.serverless/` entry
- Removed `# AWS` section  
- Removed `.aws-sam/` entry

### .env.template
- Updated header comment from "Environment Variables Template for AWS Lambda Deployment" to "Environment Variables Template"

### Source Code Changes

#### src/config/db.ts
- Removed Lambda-specific comment: "Configure mongoose for Lambda"
- Removed Lambda-specific error handling that checked for `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`
- Simplified error handling to always exit process on connection failure

#### src/controllers/questionController.ts
- Updated comment from "Create temporary file path in Lambda ephemeral storage" to "Create temporary file path"

#### src/controllers/purchaseController.ts
- Updated comment from "Register custom fonts for Lambda (must use .ttf or .otf, not .afm)" to "Register custom fonts (must use .ttf or .otf, not .afm)"

#### src/routes/questionRoutes.ts
- Updated comment from "CSV upload endpoint - preferred for Lambda" to "CSV upload endpoint"

#### postman/README.md
- Updated production environment description from "Use when testing the deployed Lambda function" to "Use when testing the deployed server"

## What Was Kept

- AWS SDK dependencies (@aws-sdk/client-s3, @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner) - These are used for S3 file storage operations
- All other application code and dependencies
- Environment variables related to AWS S3 (still needed for file uploads)

## Result

The project is now configured as a traditional Node.js/Express-style API without any AWS Lambda or Serverless Framework dependencies. The application can be deployed using standard hosting solutions like:

- Traditional VPS/dedicated servers
- Docker containers
- Platform-as-a-Service providers (Heroku, Railway, etc.)
- Kubernetes clusters

All Lambda-specific optimizations and configurations have been removed while maintaining the core functionality of the API.
